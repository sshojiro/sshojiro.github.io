## I finished my last commute

I finally finished my research internship at JBS, a Japanes SIer company. I started the internship on March 2017. The period was almost 1.5 years. The experience affected me positively and kept me well. I learned little part of natural language processing and how to make progress in a project at a company.

However, I am lack of experiences with project manager's responsibility; I'll focus on the role of manager of my Ph.D. thesis project.
