## Who proposed the famous Tanimoto coefficient?

Tanimoto coefficient is a famous indicator in cheminformatics e.g., [Why is Tanimoto index an appropriate choice for fingerprint-based similarity calculations?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456712/) to assess the similarity between two chemical compounds on the basis of substructure counts, refered to also as [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index#Tanimoto_coefficient_(extended_Jaccard_coefficient)). (Jaccard himself seemed to propose the similarity index in French).

According to several clues, [citation in a paper](https://www.scirp.org/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=251028), [discussion in mailing list](http://www.ccl.net/chemistry/resources/messages/2008/04/06.002-dir/index.html), and [daylight's instruction](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html), T. T. Tanimoto aside from Dr. Jaccard seems to have proposed the similarity metric in IBM Internal Report on 1957. But I don't know yet Tanimoto's full-name. It came to me somehow but Dr. Tanimoto and D. J. Roger published a paper onto [Sciencemag](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/132/3434/1115) (in my guess, Roger proposed the ECFP in 2010).

I investigated who T. Tanimoto is but I couldn't figure out. But at least the Tanimoto coefficient's was proposed in the IBM internal report published in 1957, or you may cite the paper of Jaccard in 1901. (I occasionally took a look at a document saying T. Tanimoto was born between Japanese parent(s) - but I am not sure.)
