title: public datasets for QSPR
---
## Motivation

A list of public datasets for QSPR or QSAR is crucial, as those types of datasets are quite rare and worthwhile. Herewith I list public datasets introduced in papers I've read recently. Hope these will help you develop a novel method.

## List of public datasets

1. [Flash point](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/minf.201900101)
   [MoleProp - github repository for the analysis](https://github.com/uw-cmg/MoleProp)
1. [Polymer Glass Transition Temperature in the supporting information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00807)

## Other hints

You may find other datasets in arXive or ChemRxiv, or either github repositories. Search them for those websites!
