title: public datasets for QSPR
---
## Motivation

A list of public datasets for QSPR or QSAR is crucial, as those types of datasets are quite rare and worthwhile. Herewith I list public datasets introduced in papers I've read recently. Hope these will help you develop a novel method.

## List of public datasets

1. [Flash point](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/minf.201900101)
   [MoleProp - github repository for the analysis](https://github.com/uw-cmg/MoleProp)
1. [Polymer Glass Transition Temperature in the supporting information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00807)
1. [Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationship Models for Ready Biodegradability of Chemicals](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci4000213)
1. [Quantitative Prediction of Hemolytic Toxicity for Small Molecules and Their Potential Hemolytic Fragments by Machine Learning and Recursive Fragmentation Methods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00102)

## Other hints

You may find other datasets in arXive or ChemRxiv, or either github repositories. Search them for those websites!
